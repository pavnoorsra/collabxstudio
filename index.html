  <!-- HERO -->
  <div class="hero">
    <h1 class="h1">Find singers and producers to collaborate with.</h1>
    <p class="p">
      CollabX Studio is a simple platform where independent musicians connect,
      share their work, and build music together.
      You choose how people contact you by setting your own platform and username.

      Singers can upload their vocal samples, and producers can upload their music or beats
      as MP3 files directly on their profiles, so everyone can listen before reaching out.

      Create a profile in under one minute and choose how people can reach you,
      or look for collaborators by clicking “Browse artists.”

  <!-- WHAT IS -->

    <div class="card">
      <h2>What is CollabX Studio?</h2>
      <p class="p">
        A focused collaboration hub for singers and producers.
        Singers upload vocal samples, producers upload music or beats,
        and both can be contacted using the platform they prefer
        (Instagram, Discord, WhatsApp, etc.).
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Why this exists</h2>
      <p class="p">
        DMs get ignored. Algorithms hide talent. Finding serious collaborators is hard.
        CollabX Studio removes the noise and lets you control how and where people reach you,
        while your music and vocals speak for themselves through your profile.
